                This year I’m hoping I can get my first job as a junior developer. Signing the contract that for the first job of my new career is going to be an amazing feeling. 
                Another thing I'm excited about is that I recently got my first VR headset, the HP Reverb G2. I am buzzing that I can fly a spaceship even if it's not quite the real thing.                </p>

                I would help create technologies that bridge the link between our brains and computers and solve problems ranging from medical all the way through to entertainment. I believe Brain Computer Interfaces will become a huge industry in the future and the possibilities are extremely exciting.                 </p>

                I am in the final term of Coder Academy’s Fast Track Coding Bootcamp. At the moment we are learning React and are about to start our final projects using MERN stack. Some of things we previously covered include Ruby (which I love), Ruby on Rails, HTML, CSS, JavaScript. It’s been an intense program so I haven’t been able to work on many projects outside of the course but I have plenty of ideas that I want to put my new skills towards.</p>

                I do a lot of reading, and I generally alternate between sci-fi/fantasy, fictionalised history and classics. I’m also a big gamer. At the moment I’m playing Hades on Switch, Doom Eternal on PC and Half Life: Alyx in VR. 
For outside activities, I enjoy running, lifting weights, bouldering and once a week I play beach volleyball. I’m almost always up for hanging out and grabbing a beer with friends.

                I want to develop a running app that uses heart rate training methodologies to increase my running ability and to track my progress through a running program. I recently learned about heart rate training and I have found that running with HR in mind instead of focusing on pace has helped me, but none of the apps I have found do exactly what I want, so why not make my own?                  </p>

                I have an obsession/passion for the reality TV show Survivor. I can list every season and winner in order, my personal rankings for best players and can discuss in depth some of the best and worst moves that players have made over the shows 40 seasons.  I really love games that require high levels of social and strategic ability and combining it with physical challenges and the deprivation of living on an island with limited food and water makes for amazing television in my opinion.                </p>
