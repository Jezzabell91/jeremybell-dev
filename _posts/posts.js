        content: ["So I haven’t touched this website in over 18 months. Quite a lot has happened for me in that time. After graduating from Coder Academy I was asked to become a teaching assistant for the Code, Cloud and Cyber course. This was a 10 month, full time course that covered the basics of web development with HTML and CSS, programming with Python, developing cloud applications with AWS and cyber security basics. I enjoyed this role immensely. It was very satisfying helping the students learn and it was great for me as it reinforced a lot of the concepts that I learnt as a student.", "After the course finished in March I was approached by a cryptocurrency company, Hello One, to develop a login and authentication system using AWS for their game Doge Dash. After that 8 week contract I decided to go travelling. I left Brisbane in May and I have recently returned. My route was Singapore → Lithuania → England → Scotland → Bulgaria → Romania → Turkey → Greece → Australia. I travelled solo, and I had an incredible time. The biggest highlight was solo camping on Ben Vrackie, a mountain in the Scottish Highlands. It felt surreal to be utterly alone in such a magnificent place. I am so happy I was able to do this trip.", "Now that I am back I am starting the process of looking for new work. My main priority is finding a good employer, working on products I can be proud of and which align with my values."]

        content: ["In February 2021 I finished Coder Academy’s 6 month long Fast Track Coding Bootcamp and it was one of the best educational experiences I have had. It was tough, and it occasionally pushed my limits, but it was rewarding, and I have left with the confidence that I am on the right path for future learning and my career.", "The thing that I liked most was of course the people I shared the experience with. In University I found it rare to find people that were driven and determined to push themselves. This was not the case at Coder Academy. Most people put in a tremendous amount of effort to learn the content and take the most from the opportunity. For me, being surrounded by hard working peers was a source of motivation and the environment was much more collaborative than it was competitive.", "Could I have learnt the content on my own? Yes and no. There was nothing content wise that was at a level that I could not have understood through self-learning, but I also know that in my previous self-learning efforts that every time I reached a significant roadblock I would struggle with motivation and self-belief. Having the educators and other students there to help when things got hard helped me push through those roadblocks. So yeah, I could have probably done it by myself but it would have taken years instead of months and so I think the investment in the course was worth it in terms of economic value and my own sanity."]
